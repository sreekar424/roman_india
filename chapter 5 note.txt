The royal inscriptions of Darius and Xerxes (Old Persian) were trilingual, with Elamite and Babylonian as well as Aramaic versions. Darius’ inscription at Persepolis, for instance, refers to various peoples and their submission to him. This linguistic tradition may have influenced the Roman practice of bilingual inscriptions in Latin and Greek, and sometimes in Greek and the local language of the province.

37 Augustus, despite his autocratic power, was careful to present himself as a restorer of the Roman Republic rather than a dictator. This political maneuvering is evident in his choice of titles and offices, such as Princeps and Imperator, which carried connotations of traditional Republican authority.

38 For example, the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great, where Darius describes his conquests and the submission of various peoples: "I am Darius, the great king, king of kings, king of Persia, king of the provinces, son of Hystaspes, grandson of Arsames, an Achaemenian" (DB 1.1).

This discusses the significance of India in the context of the Roman Empire, drawing on quotes from Plato and Pliny. It explores the changing perceptions of India as the farthest corner of the earth and its role in measuring the world. The chapter delves into the idea that India marked the ends of the world and its connection to the Roman Empire. It discusses the relationship between conceptions of space and the self-presentation of emperors, particularly during the monarchy period. The text also addresses the difficulty in defining empire and imperialism, examining the role of India in understanding the meaning of "empire" in different periods of Roman history. The chapter traces the discourse about empire from the Augustan age to late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. It explores how India served as a marker of the distant periphery and its symbolic significance in the Roman understanding of the world. The passage highlights the intricate questions surrounding the borders of the empire and the ends of the earth, emphasizing the overlaps and distinctions between the two concepts.

to military considerations are the references to the eastern frontier in the Res Gestae, which mention the Euphrates River as a natural boundary and the Parthians as potential adversaries. However, even here, the focus is more on the geopolitical situation in the eastern Mediterranean rather than on direct military plans for India.

It's worth noting that the Romans had limited direct contact with India, mainly through trade routes. The lack of detailed military planning or conquest strategies for India in Roman sources supports the idea that India was more of a symbolic or ideological concept in the discourse of empire during the Augustan age.

So, while the rhetoric of empire and references to India were prevalent in the ideological and cultural spheres of Roman society, there's little evidence to suggest that the Romans had concrete military plans or strategies for India. The emphasis on India in Roman texts seems to be more about projecting an image of a vast and all-encompassing empire rather than detailing specific military endeavors in that region.

110 Historiae adversus paganos, Pref. 2: “We have treated the fortunes of the whole human race, making no distinction between Romans and non-Romans, since no difference between them appeared in the comparison. We took pains to present the affairs of individuals and of whole nations together, in a history intended to show by what sequence of events God brought the nations to the domination of the Roman empire and arranged the various sequences of events among them. We wished to show how all nations were at last put in the power of the Roman empire, so that there should be only one nation at peace in the world, even though there had been peace in different places at different times. And so, when there was peace in the world, Christ, the Son of God, was born, so that he might teach the human race to believe, to hope and to love.”

111 Orosius’ tripartite division of the world into three continents—Asia, Africa, and Europe—is in contrast to the classical division of Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa). The tripartite division aligns with the Christian theological framework of the Holy Trinity.

hand, Cosmas is convinced that the earth is flat, and so he finds the notion of antipodes absurd. His own model of the world is that of a flat, rectangular plane, with a vaulted sky above. The idea of symmetry across the equatorial plain is thus foreign to his conceptual framework.

While Cosmas’ work, known as "Christian Topography" or "Christian Topography of the World," was not widely influential in medieval Europe, it provides a unique perspective on the intersection of ancient geography, Christian theology, and the rejection of classical scientific ideas. His rejection of the spherical Earth and the idea of antipodes reflects the tensions between classical and Christian worldviews during the late antiquity.

 The passage delves into the intricate details of how India was represented in Roman geographical and literary contexts. It seems like the Romans had a keen interest in depicting and understanding the far-reaching corners of their world. It's fascinating how the concept of India, though not directly under Roman rule, was incorporated into their imperial framework. The discussion on maps and visual representations adds another layer to the complexity of how they perceived and conveyed geographical information.
