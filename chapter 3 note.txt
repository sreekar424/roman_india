On the silver platter from Lampsacus, we find another personification of India. She is depicted as a woman seated on the ground, surrounded by various symbols. In her right hand, she holds an elephant tusk, and in her left, a cornucopia. To her left is an elephant, and to her right, a camel. Above the camel is a tree, and above the elephant, a bird, possibly a peacock. The scene is completed with a border of animals, including panthers, griffins, and elephants.

These personifications are fascinating glimpses into how different cultures and regions were visually represented in the ancient world. Whether through the triumph of Bacchus, the hunt mosaics, or the allegorical figures, artists captured the essence of India in ways that reflected both reality and the imaginative interpretations of distant lands.


 where India unfolds its essence through rich and intricate depictions.

Imagine standing before the great hunt mosaic of the Villa Filosofiana in Sicily, a masterpiece from the fourth century AD. Here, a dark-skinned woman, poised on a rock, captures the spirit of India. Half-naked and barefoot, she cradles an elephant tusk in one hand, a symbol of abundance that replaces the typical cornucopia. To her right, an elephant stands majestically, possibly evoking the grandeur of the Roman province of Africa. On her left, a tiger prowls, a creature unmistakably associated with the mystique of India.

Now, shift your gaze to a silver platter from Lampsacus, a relic from the sixth century. Picture a seated woman, surrounded by a tapestry of symbolism. In her grasp, an elephant tusk and a cornucopia intertwine, emblematic of prosperity and fertility. Flanking her are an elephant and a camel, representing the exotic allure of distant lands. Above them, a tree and a bird, perhaps a peacock, add layers of meaning and cultural richness. The intricate border completes the tableau with panthers, griffins, and more elephants, creating a visual symphony that brings ancient India to life.
These personifications aren't mere artworks; they are portals to the past, offering glimpses into how diverse cultures were perceived and celebrated in the tapestry of ancient civilizations.




The discussion begins with the examination of two artifacts: a mosaic from Sicily and a silver platter from Istanbul. The mosaic, discovered in Piazza Armerina, showcases a woman surrounded by elephants, a tiger, and various exotic elements, providing a visual feast of abundance and opulence. The silver platter, found in Lampsacus, introduces a female figure seated on elephant tusks, adorned with a turban and intriguing objects, adding an air of mystique to the narrative.

The meticulous analysis extends to the woman's attire on the platter, emphasizing a richly embroidered robe, uncovered right breast, necklace, and bracelets. The inclusion of a parrot, guinea-fowl, monkeys, and men accompanied by large cats further deepens the symbolic layers of the artifact. The varied substances used, such as gold rim, gilding, and black enamel, contribute to the complexity of the platter, whose "Indianness" is affirmed by the connection to Indian motifs like the Salabhanjika.

Moving forward, the note draws parallels between Roman and Indian attire, specifically referencing Curtius' description of Indian clothing. The personification of India in Roman art as a province is highlighted, despite the historical fact that India was never a Roman province. The possible link to imperial ideology and the influence of Alexander as a precedent add intriguing dimensions to the discussion.

The exploration shifts to the Christian topography of Cosmas Indicopleustes, offering a unique perspective grounded in theological and cosmological considerations. Cosmas, a trader who traveled to India and Africa, presents a less marvellous India, emphasizing the mundane aspects such as animals, in contrast to the fantastical creatures often associated with the subcontinent.

The note then contemplates the absence of visual representations of Indian holy men, a notable gap in the narrative. The discussion concludes by acknowledging the contrasting dynamics of continuity and change in Western depictions of India, illustrated by later artifacts like the Mughal scene and the British-made imperial monument.

This nuanced exploration provides a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted ways in which ancient Greeks and Romans envisioned India through art, symbolism, and cultural contexts.
