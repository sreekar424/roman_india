Pliny's figures of 100 million sesterces for the eastern trade would represent a substantial portion of the overall imperial budget. However, this estimate assumes that all of the money spent on luxury goods was a drain on the Roman economy, which might not be entirely accurate.

The eastern trade, particularly with India and China, involved the exchange of high-value luxury items, such as silk, spices, and precious stones, which were not readily available in the Roman world. While the actual volume of these goods might not have been massive in comparison to staple products, their high value could still contribute significantly to the monetary value of the trade.

Moreover, the eastern trade was not solely a one-way flow of wealth out of the Roman Empire. The Romans were exporting goods, including wine, glassware, and textiles, to the East. The circulation of these Roman products could have offset some of the economic drain caused by the importation of luxury items.

Additionally, the eastern trade had broader economic implications. It stimulated commercial activities, created demand for transportation services, and encouraged the development of new markets. Merchants, shippers, and other participants in the trade would have profited, contributing to the overall economic dynamism of the empire.

So, while Pliny's figures may not provide a precise economic analysis, they do highlight the significance of the eastern trade in the Roman economy. It was a complex system with multifaceted effects, and separating the moralizing rhetoric from the economic realities requires a nuanced understanding of the broader economic context.
